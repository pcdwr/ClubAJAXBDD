This is the last branch created prior to the presentation.

1. Cleaned up presentation and created PDF
2. Moved server.js to root since it serves both static and rest services.
3. Removed unused node modules and javascript
4. Changed scripts to use local cucumber.js instead of global
5. Created scripts to run tests using node without make
6. Changed tests to use second database so that batch and online tests don't interfere with each other

Next stop - play with some step definitions
